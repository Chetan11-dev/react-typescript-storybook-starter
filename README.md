# Sass, Storybook, ReactJs, ReduxToolkit,Typescript Starter

Special Thanks to creator of https://github.com/sw-yx/react-typescript-storybook-starter.git on which it is based

Due to storybook and react needed different tsconfig in order to work I was unable to find how to make multiple tsconfig work there is some hackiness in package.json.runstorybook (Tested in Linux) (Doubtfult if it works on windows - raise an issue if it works I will update Readme)

Install libraries

```
yarn install
```

Run storybook

```
yarn runstorybook
```

Run React App

```
yarn start
```

Happy Coding
